# Description

Hangman is a guessing game where the player must guess a word letter by letter. The player is only given the length of the word. This program allows you to play hangman against the computer.

# How to play?

The program will select a random word from the word bank. Blank spaces will be printed on the screen. Guess a letter by clicking on it. For each incorrect guess, part of the hangman will be drawn on.  If you guess all the letters before the hangman is completely drawn on the screen, you win! If the hangman is fully drawn before you guess the word, you lose.
